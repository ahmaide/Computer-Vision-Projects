# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains three computer vision projects designed for the computer vision university course.

## Project 1: Image Reformations

This project focuses on grey image reformations, including noise cancellation, edge detection, and measuring differences. It involves the implementation of different methods for these purposes.

## Project 2: Image Color Feature Extraction

This project involves the classification of labeled images using color histograms and color moments as feature extractors. Different parameters are implemented to explore their effects on classification performance.

## Project 3: Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition with CNN

This project features a deep learning implementation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify handwritten Arabic characters. It includes data augmentation, the use of known CNN architectures, and the application of transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs.
